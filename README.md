# Cluster-and-Language-Detection-App
This project was a Uni assessment where we had to configure a cluster using virtual machines and secure it with Kerberos.
Then use hdfs to store a certain amount of books and build a Scala app that would determine the most commonly used language of those words (English, French, German).
